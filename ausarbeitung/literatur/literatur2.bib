@misc{0903.3218v1,
	abstract = {  The treatment of Internet traffic is increasingly affected by national
policies that require the ISPs in a country to adopt common protocols or
practices. Examples include government enforced censorship, wiretapping, and
protocol deployment mandates for IPv6 and DNSSEC. If an entire nation's worth
of ISPs apply common policies to Internet traffic, the global implications
could be significant. For instance, how many countries rely on China or Great
Britain (known traffic censors) to transit their traffic? These kinds of
questions are surprisingly difficult to answer, as they require combining
information collected at the prefix, Autonomous System, and country level, and
grappling with incomplete knowledge about the AS-level topology and routing
policies. In this paper we develop the first framework for country-level
routing analysis, which allows us to answer questions about the influence of
each country on the flow of international traffic. Our results show that some
countries known for their national policies, such as Iran and China, have
relatively little effect on interdomain routing, while three countries (the
United States, Great Britain, and Germany) are central to international
reachability, and their policies thus have huge potential impact.

  abstract = "The Internet has matured to a critical infrastructure in many countries.
  The national importance of routing motivates us to study the AS-level subgraph that
  is relevant for a country. In this paper, we report on a methodology and tool chain
  for identifying and classifying a 'national Internet', and evaluate detailed results
  for the example of Germany. Our contribution (a) identifies the ASes that are
  important for the country, (b) classifies these ASes into functional sectors, (c)
  constructs the AS routing graph of a country as well as subgraphs of specific sectors,
  and (d) analyzes structural dependencies between key players. Our methods indicate the
  importance of examining individual IP-blocks held by individual organizations, as this
  reveals 25\% more stakeholders compared to only looking at prefixes. We quantify the
  centrality of ASes with respect to specific sectors and the robustness of
  communication communities. Our results show that members of sectoral groups tend to
  avoid direct peering, but inter-connect via a small set of common ISPs. Even though
  applied for Germany here, all methods are designed general enough to work for most
  countries, as well.",
